# Please read
Seven Bridges will no longer develop the Open Source version of Rabix Executor. Please use the open source [CWLtool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) instead. CWLtool is actively developed, maintained and supported by the CWL community, including Seven Bridges.

Back in the very early days, when Seven Bridges was initiating the development of the Common Workflow Language specification, we needed a technology demonstrator to take a workflow described in CWL and run it locally. In this role, the Apache 2.0 licensed, java based Rabix Executor has been a valuable tool for Seven Bridges and the CWL community. As the adoption of CWL increased, Seven Bridges Genomics and the community started work on CWLtool: a Python based CWL executor. CWLtool is more amenable to the rapid prototype and release cycle that the current stage of CWL development demands. Seven Bridges is now discontinuing further development of the open source Rabix Executor and will focus it's open source development on CWLtool.
